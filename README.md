# CareerFoundry-Introduction-to-Data-Analytics-Final-Project-Reflections

In these two executive summaries, as part of my CareerFoundry final presentation, I demonstrate my ability to analyze data and detail strategic issues facing a business using pivot tables, slicers, and charts. I welcome your review. TU. Patrick

Course Synopsis: Capitalizing on my financial risk management background, I aced this introductory course desgined to accelerate my Excel skills to process, analyze, and create recommendations utilizing actual data sets to demonstrate my ability to make actionable, real world decisions. Using descriptive analyses, Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Charts to sort, filter, format, organize, and create useful visualizations, this course prepared me to go from disorganized data to focused recommendations.

In between, I incorporated bias prevention, descriptive, predictive, and diagnostic analyses (and knowing when to apply), as well as rigorous statistical methods to quell noise, understand root issues, and offer neutral, data-driven suggestions to grow the business.
